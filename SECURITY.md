## 🏰 Hack Challenge

Think you can bypass Origin Fortress? We want you to try.

**[hack-origin-fortress](https://github.com/darfaz/hack-origin-fortress)** — our official challenge repo with guided scenarios for testing Origin Fortress's defenses. Bypass a scanner, escape the policy engine, or tamper with audit logs.

Valid bypasses qualify for recognition in our security program.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- **Scanner bypasses** — Attacks that evade Origin Fortress's detection (prompt injection, jailbreak, secret scanning)
- **Policy engine bypasses** — Tool calls that circumvent policy rules
- **Host Guardian escapes** — Breaking out of permission tiers
- **Audit log tampering** — Ways to modify or forge audit entries
- **Insider threat detection evasion** — Bypassing behavioral analysis
- **Dependency issues** — Vulnerabilities in Origin Fortress's dependencies

**Out of scope:**

- Denial of service via large inputs (expected behavior — use input size limits)
- False positives/negatives in detection (please open a regular issue)
- Vulnerabilities in upstream LLM providers
